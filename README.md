Based on git-amend's tutorial and code:
* https://github.com/tellemstevedave/unity-multi-scene.git
* https://github.com/adammyhre/Unity-Inventory-System/tree/master/Assets/_Project/Scripts/SceneManagement

This is just the scene loading code from the github minus:
* any links to other parts of the project
* any reliance on odin inspector

Tested on Mac with clean Unity 6 install plus:
* addressables package
